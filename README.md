# Color Prediction Game

## Overview

The **Color Prediction Game** is a simple web-based game that allows users to place bets on different colors (Green, Violet, or Red). The game provides a balance that decreases when the user loses a bet and increases when they win. The goal is to showcase the mechanics of color prediction games while promoting awareness about the risks of gambling and online scams.

> **Warning:** Many color prediction games are designed to create an illusion of easy wins but eventually drain users' balances. Always be cautious when engaging with such games.

## Features

- **Balance System:** Users start with a balance and can place bets to either win or lose.
- **Betting System:** Users can place bets on one of the three colors (Green, Violet, or Red).
- **Results Section:** Displays the result of each bet (win/loss) along with the updated balance.
- **Recharge System:** Users can recharge their balance to continue playing, with bonus amounts offered for recharges.
- **Awareness Message:** When the balance reaches zero, a warning message appears, educating users about the risks associated with online prediction games.
